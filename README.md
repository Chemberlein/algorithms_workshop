# Algorithms workshop 
(Warrning : aplication still in develop)
You need to install raylib libary to be able to compile this project
Right now application support following comands :
	rg <n> - generate random graph with n points
	clear - clear canvas
	ch[ni|fi|ri|ci]tsp Convex hull heuristic to solve tsp using nierest insertion (ni) or farthest insertion (fi) or random insertion (ri) or cheapest insertion (ci)
	chgs - convex hull Graham Scan
	chj - convex hull jarvis algorithm
	ritsp random insertion heuristic to solve tsp
	citsp cheapest insertion heuristic to sove tsp
	fitsp farthest insertion heuristic to solve tsp
	nitsp nearest insertion tsp solution
	mstp - show minimal spanding tree computed with Prim algorithm
	mstk - show minimal spanding tree computed with Kruscal algorithm
	nntsp - solve tsp with neares neigbor algorithm
	kmsttsp- tsp solution using Kruscal mst
	pmsttsp - tspsolution using Prim mst
